I am a passionate technology geek seeking to push my skills and
abilities to new levels. My career has exposed me to a broad range of
technologies, and it has been a humbling journey. I love learning about
practically any topic, and I thrive in enviornments where learning is a
constant requirement. I'm currently focused on sharpening my low-level
programming abilities and reducing the number of abstractions between
myself and the bare metal.\
